## Acknowledgments 
* This project was for the participation of the Unreal Engine 4 Winter Game Jam contest, but to have fun and gain experience purposes. Due to the time constraints (very short amount of times: 4 days or less) of this contest, the game did not finish what I intended and decided at the beginning of the design process, and also lacking the unreal experience and team works.
* First game jam participation.
