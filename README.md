# IceGround
A small and simple game developed for the Winter UE4 GameJam contest. Implemented the game to accurately match the announced theme: On Thin Ice. The game included a simple gameplay structure that spawned a robot playable character on the level first, and then the player had to cross the artic ocean platform on the level inorder to beat the game. However, there are some breakable ice tiles spawned on the icy water platform to obstruct the player. Whenever the player standed on a breakable ice panel, it cracked and dropped down to the ocean and so does the player. Then the player resulted a game over screen. If the player managed to corss the ice platform successfully, they beat the game. The game also included other audios: a background music (on Main Menu and in the gameplay), playing sounds when the ice panel breaks and the game over. Also some interfaces that included: the main menu, game over screen, and winning screen.

## Acknowledgments 
* This project was for the participation of the Unreal Engine 4 Winter Game Jam contest, but to have fun and gain experience purposes. Due to the time constraints (very short amount of times: 4 days or less) of this contest, the game did not finish what I intended and decided at the beginning of the design process, and also lacking the unreal experience and team works.
* First game jam participation.
